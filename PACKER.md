### Pros:
1. [Support for all major public cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCE)](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/index.html)
2. [Support for all major HyperVisors (VMWare, Parallels, QEMU, HyperV, Virtual Box)](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/index.html)
3. [Support for all major Provisioners (Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Salt)](https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/index.html)
4. [Post processors that allow for automatic pushing artifacts to repositories (AWS, Docker, GCE)](https://www.packer.io/docs/post-processors/index.html)
5. [Can also be used to package Docker containers as artifacts](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/docker.html)
6. Large user base and many active developers therefore CVE's are handled in a timely manner.
7. Can build a base imageÂ using the image file provided by the distribution
8. [Can build images in parallel](https://www.packer.io/intro/getting-started/parallel-builds.html)


### Cons:
1. Does not directly support bare metal
    - [However, it may be possible to convert a VBox and Libvert artifact images to a bare metal image](https://github.com/viralpoetry/packer-bare-metal)
    - https://askubuntu.com/questions/32499/migrate-from-a-virtual-machine-vm-to-a-physical-system
2. CenturyLink cloud is not listed as supported

### Stateful data
Stateful data can be managed using a Vagrant or VB guest additions host to guest directory sharing.

### Upgradability
If as many configuration steps as possible are baked into the image, upgrading should be very quick. 
However, it may be possible to share the same directory on the host machine with multiple VM's allowing a new version to start up while the previous version continues to run.
**NOTE:** I have not tested this with persistent databases.
